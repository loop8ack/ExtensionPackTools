--------------------------------------

This extension allows you to export a list of extensions and importing them back into any instance of VS 2017.

**Figure 1.** The **Export Extensions** and **Import Extensions** menu commands.

## Export

The **Export Extensions** dialog box appears that lets you select which extensions you wish to export.

Check the boxes for the extension(s) you wish to export, and then click **Export** to perform the operation.

Click the **Select/deselect all** to toggle back and forth between selecting or deselecting all the extensions in the list.

The output is a JSON file with an `.vsext` file extension looking like this:

```json
{
  "id": "49481cf2-0f02-462e-b8b7-9ecc53fee721",
  "name": "My Visual Studio extensions",
  "description": "A collection of my Visual Studio extensions",

### New Export Fields

Of note are new entries: `moreInfoUrl` and `downloadUrl` for each extension.  These are now exported along with the `vsixId` and `name` fields.

#### The `moreInfoUrl` field

The `moreInfoUrl` field points to the Visual Studio Marketplace page of the extension.  If you open this URL in a Web browser, then the Visual Studio marketplace will show that extension's page:

![More Info Url Sample](art/moreInfoUrl_sample.png)

**Figure 3.** Google Chrome opened to the URL in the `moreInfoUrl` field for the `Windows App SDK (Experimental)` extension.

#### The `downloadUrl` field

The `downloadUrl` field points to the URL that a `HTTP GET` request can be issued to in order to obtain the `.vsix` file of the extension itself.

### Example Use Case for New Export Fields

The file can be parsed by a custom script you write.  The use case is, e.g., say a Sysadmin at a large organization needs to install the same suite of extensions into all the Visual Studio 2019 instances in a computer lab.

For such a use case, the procedure is as follows:

1. Configure a 'reference' workstation's copy of Visual Studio with the set of extensions you want.
2. Also install this extension.
3. Do an `Export Extensions` operation from the menu command.
4. Save the `.vsext` file to a common location where your script can see it.
5. Download and install the extensions, using your script, across all your computer-lab machines.

## Import
Clicking the import button prompts you to select a `.vsext` file. Doing that will present you with the **Import Extensions** dialog that lists all the extensions found in the `.vsext` file you selected.

![Import](art/import.png)

**Figure 4.** The **Import Extensions** dialog box.

Before showing the list it will verify that the extensions exist on the Marketplace and that can take a few seconds.

Any extensions in the import file that are already installed in Visual Studio will be grayed out.

Clicking the **Import** button in the dialog will start the VSIX Installer in a separate process and you can follow the normal install flow from there.

## Manage Solution Extensions
This allows you to specify which extensions needed to work on any given solution. When a developer opens the solution and doesn't have one or more of the extensions installed, they are prompted to install them.

Right-click the solution to manage the extensions.

This will show this dialog where you can pick wich of your extensions to associate with the solution.

![Manage solution extensions](art/manage-solution-extensions.png)

**Figure 6.** The **Manage Solution Extensions** dialog box.

To create a `.vsext` file containing the checked extensions in a location on the local disk that is next to the Solution file (`.sln`), check the extensions you want, and then click the **Select** button.  

You have the option to commit the generated .vsext file to souce control.  This is highly recommended.
